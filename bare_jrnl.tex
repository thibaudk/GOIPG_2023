% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

Designing Human-Machine interactions for live performance can require representation and control of events through time. Several theoretical models have been developed to that effect over the years and some are implemented in software of various complexity. When it comes to hardware however, time is mostly understood as linear, unique and regular. This is notably the case for systems using one of the most prevalent physical interface to edit and play sequences, the button grid, with its rich history, from early drum machines to the ever-present Digital Audio Workstaion controllers of today. This research, drawing from both fields of interactive media notation and New Interfaces for Musical Expression, will explore non-linear temporal models and propose an implementation of common phisycal interfaces and interactions better suited to these models. A prime candidate for this exploration would be the interactive scores as implemented in the software \textit{ossia score}\cite{jcelerier:thesis}, where branching timelines can be drawn to execute media sequences and their processing interactively, in parallel scenarios of variable speed and duration.
The open-ended scheduling \textit{ossia score} allows would necessitate the elaboration of a divergent approach to translate to a hardware interface for musical expression.
What computing challenges would such a translation entail ? This inquiry would first have to establish the minimal essential requirement in score's graphical user interface, and indeed, in its temporal model.

\subsection{Aims, objectives and central research question}
How can we interact with open ended, abstract software on finite physical interfaces ? This question is particularly delicate with software straying far away from the norm, and hardware interfaces incarnating conventions in musical expression.
The field of interactive media notation addresses how the nature of scored material blurs the line between notation and execution. This is especially the case with today's growing variety of data formats, encompassing audio, lights, graphics, up to and including augmented and virtual reality. 
Advances in this research area have culminated in the development of notable programs including Antescofo\cite{ircam:antescofo}, Iannix\cite{buzzing:iannix} or INScore\cite{grame:inscore}.
Each in their own right, these software are unparalleled in the music technology landscape. The computing models they implement enable writing blueprints for automated processes to assist, accompany, enhance and often bypass the need for human-readable cues and performers. Their use has led to interesting superposition of roles that could be qualified by "scores as conductors", "instruments as scores" or "scores as final pieces". I posit here that hardware sequencers superimpose instruments and notation tools by design. Even in their most minimal, bare bone cases, sequencer layouts feature a playing interface, a human readable representation of a sequence end some editing functionalities.
Interacting with these features bring the trial and error of composition to the real time of instrumental performance. This is referred to as a performance-driven system\cite{nash:liveness}. Where this is fairly common practice in the use of hardware, in the sole use of software however, such propensity for improvisation seems to only be matched in the very niche case of live coding\cite{blackwell:livecoding}.
This convergence of practices that contributes to the appeal of hardware sequencers often comes at the price of rigid limitations in the manipulation of the structure, both in terms of the signal path and the form of the sequence itself.
In the interactive scores formalism on which we propose to base our work, arrangements and effect chains, like all synthesis and input processing, can be defined with flexible duration, inside interactive timelines. Here lies the main challenge in attempting to fit score's originality in a familiar practice. Even with button grids serving as very low-resolution touchscreens;
and their various innovative uses of today\footnote{This forum entry lists some of these innovations: forum.ossia.io/t/simplified-portable-interfaces/198} allowing for example the display and control of basic widgets like sliders, routing matrices, patching environment or waveform editors; this research will necessitate a novel implementation. While exploring new paradigms\footnote{For example, a two dimensional representation of time as outlined in the following forum entry: forum.ossia.io/t/dynamic-reshaping-of-sequences/96}, we will strive to outline the specificities of performance-driven systems (as in \cite{nash:liveness}).

\subsection{Existing literature}
The field of interactive media notation\cite{ircam:antescofo}\cite{buzzing:iannix}\cite{grame:inscore} provide extensive references at the cross section of graphical user interface, human input and real time constraints, that are central to this work. 
The elaboration of the branching timeline model was rooted in research applying Allen's interval algebra\cite{allombert:constraint} and Petry nets\cite{allombert:petri} to musical composition and performance. Conditional branching was later introduced\cite{toro:condition}, prompting further research to cope with the added complexity and uncertainty\cite{arias:colour}. Recently, a research project by a student group at the University of Bordeaux identified several ways to improve the user interface to interact with this model, by comparing common practices across nodal environments\footnote{Official web page: cmarty008.wixsite.com/ux-nodales}. On the hardware side, the latest innovations are most likely presented at the International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME)\footnote{Official web page: nime.pubpub.org}. The 2021 edition featured both an extensive survey on the use of grid controllers\cite{rossmy:grid} and a taxonomy for the specific type of interaction they demand\cite{pust:taxonomy}. This can serve as a base assessment for our purposes. 
NIME also features creations of new hardware for sequencing\cite{arellano:radear}, exploring in some cases non-linear approaches\cite{hayes:neurohedron}. Several research projects also focused on rethinking and improving upon more classical designs\cite{snyder:jd} including button grids\cite{rossmy:touch}. Innovative work on hardware may also be done in a effort to bridge accessibility issues\cite{forester:loopblocks}, especially when doing away with the common use of a computer screen and a mouse. These concerns may also be relevant in the work proposed here, since we hope to provide full access to interactive score authoring without relying on GUIs. Implementing a complete controller for the terminal could both be a useful milestone as well as a step towards greater accessibility, in particular for the sight-impaired. 

\subsection{Contribution to existing knowledge}
Even with this wealth of available research in the domain of creative interfaces, the private sector seems to lead the way, at least in terms of popularization the latest innovations. If many of the products on the market today where made possible by previous academic research, it is indeed land mark commercial products and their wide spread availability that set the standard. Today, this method of ``punching in'' steps along a fixed timeline has become a staple of the producer's tool-set.

As such, one could argue that the practice demonstrates a certain intuitiveness by restriction, if only to the familiarity of a tried-and-true paradigm. It is our assumption that the program Ableton Live in particular, with its long held monopoly and well established feature set, must hinder fair comparisons against a new research project. Innovations in this domain face the added challenge of matching the industry standard in term of usability and convenience. The proposed research hopes to meet this challenge, and in the process, provide open source, generic implementations of button grids interactions and feedback. We believe that laying this ground work can be beneficial for further research on these user experiences. \\

Note: This pursuit for seamless interactions would also tie in with previous theoretical research on embedded systems considering the implementation of interactive scores in Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAS)\cite{arias:fpga}. Working with such dedicated hardware and harnessing the optimization they afford would yield great improvements in the reactivity of real-time interactions\cite{popoff:fpga}.

\subsection{Risks}
Too close to existing literature, so the research ought to be more applied, or too far form the existent, so the research ought to be more theoretical.
\subsection{Contingency plans}

\section{Specialist knowledge} % Max 500 words
% Please describe any specialist knowledge or data required to undertake your proposed research, such as language competency, technical skills or use of specialist software. If this knowledge or data is not already in place, details should be provided as to how it will be acquired over the course of the scholarship: 
A thorough theoretical understanding of the relevant temporal models will be necessary to propose striped down representations fitted to hardware interfaces. 
% Theoretical understanding of user interaction and feedback
Additionally, in 2023, the new version of the programming language C++ (c++23) will be officially released. The previous version (c++20) introduced major new features that this version will further extend. Mastering this modern, more generic approach to programming\footnote{This blog entry outlines  the use of these modern techniques in the writing of audio plugins: ossia.io/posts/reflection/} will be instrumental in ensuring the output of this research is as robust and future proof as possible.

Since the end of 2021, I have been the lead developer of the Viage client application\footnote{github.com/EuclidTradingSystems/viage} for the real-estate market. Ease of use, layout simplicity and navigation calrity have been central concerns in this work. Cross platform compatibility and performances also played a substantial role in trying to provide a sim-less experience for users of non technical background. Direct contact with the client also offers me a privileged look into the scrutiny required by the private sector in terms of convenience and intuitive interfaces. Concurrently, I am also working as the Systems administrator for the Euclid\footnote{euclidtradingsystems.com} company, overseeing the migration to their new data-center. This position involves hardware installation and maintenance, as well as the upkeep and improvement of the software infrastructure to ensure that daily operations are running smoothly.

%     • How can the scholarship transform your existing skills in those identified as being required to pursue the chosen career?





% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.
%
%\begin{figure}[!t]
%\centering
%\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{myfigure}
% where an .eps filename suffix will be assumed under latex, 
% and a .pdf suffix will be assumed for pdflatex; or what has been declared
% via \DeclareGraphicsExtensions.
%\caption{Simulation results for the network.}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure}

% Note that the IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command,
% and the \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil is used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% Watch out that the combined width of all the subfigures on a 
% line do not exceed the text width or a line break will occur.
%
%\begin{figure*}[!t]
%\centering
%\subfloat[Case I]{\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{box}%
%\label{fig_first_case}}
%\hfil
%\subfloat[Case II]{\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{box}%
%\label{fig_second_case}}
%\caption{Simulation results for the network.}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.
% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure
% labels, the optional argument to \subfloat must be present. If a
% subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,
% e.g., \subfloat[].


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table and, given that table
% captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words
% such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to
% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
% the IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells
%\caption{An Example of a Table}
%\label{table_example}
%\centering
%% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables
%% than the plain LaTeX2e tabular which is used here.
%\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
%\hline
%One & Two\\
%\hline
%Three & Four\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that the IEEE does not put floats in the very first column
% - or typically anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also,
% in-text middle ("here") positioning is typically not used, but it
% is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but
% not Computer Society journals). Most IEEE journals/conferences use
% top floats exclusively. 
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the
% \fnbelowfloat command of the stfloats package.

% if have a single appendix:
%\appendix[Proof of the Zonklar Equations]
% or
%\appendix  % for no appendix heading
% do not use \section anymore after \appendix, only \section*
% is possibly needed

% use appendices with more than one appendix
% then use \section to start each appendix
% you must declare a \section before using any
% \subsection or using \label (\appendices by itself
% starts a section numbered zero.)
%


\appendices
% \section{Proof of the First Zonklar Equation}
% Appendix one text goes here.

% you can choose not to have a title for an appendix
% if you want by leaving the argument blank
% \section{}
% Appendix two text goes here.


% use section* for acknowledgment
