% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.

Designing Human-Machine interactions for live performance can require representation and control of events through time. Several theoretical models have been developed to that effect over the years: some are implemented in software of various complexity. When it comes to hardware however, time is mostly understood as linear, unique and regular. This is notably the case for systems using one of the most prevalent physical interface to edit and play sequences, the button grid, with its rich history, from early drum machines to the ubiquitous Digital Audio Workstation controllers of today. This research, drawing from both fields of interactive media notation and New Interfaces for Musical Expression, will explore non-linear temporal models and propose an implementation of common physical interfaces and interactions better suited to these models. A prime candidate for this exploration are the interactive scores as implemented in the software \textit{ossia score}, where branching timelines can be drawn to execute media sequences and their processing interactively, in parallel scenarios of variable speed and duration.
The open-ended scheduling \textit{ossia score} enables necessitates the elaboration of a divergent approach to translate to a hardware interface for musical expression.
Which computing challenges would such a translation entail? This inquiry would first have to establish the minimal essential requirement in score's graphical user interface, and in its temporal model.

\subsection{Aims, objectives and central research question}
% How can graphical representation of time translate to hardware interfaces, and what would such a translation entail for interacting with different temporal modals ?
The field of interactive media notation addresses how the nature of scored material blurs the line between notation and execution. 
% This is especially the case with today's growing variety of data formats, encompassing audio, lights, graphics, up to and including augmented and virtual reality. 
Advances in this research area have culminated in the development of notable software including ossia score\cite{jcelerier:thesis},  Antescofo \cite{ircam:antescofo}, Iannix \cite{buzzing:iannix} or INScore \cite{grame:inscore}.
% Each in their own right, these software are unparalleled in the music technology landscape. 
The computing models they implement enable writing blueprints for automated processes to assist, accompany, enhance and often bypass the need for human-readable cues and performers. Their use has led to interesting superpositions of roles: ``scores as conductors'', ``instruments as scores'' or ``scores as final pieces''. I posit that hardware sequencers superimpose instruments and notation tools by design. Even in their most minimal and bare-bones cases, sequencer layouts feature a playback interface, a human-readable representation of a sequence and editing functionalities.
% Interacting with these features brings the trial and error of musical composition to the real time of instrumental performance. This is referred to as a performance-driven system \cite{nash:liveness}. While this is fairly common practice when using hardware, in the case of exclusive software music-making, such propensity for improvisation seems to only be matched in the very niche case of live-coding \cite{blackwell:livecoding}.
We aim to bring the immediacy of hardware sequencers to the editing and manipulation of interactive scores' temporal models.
% This convergence of practices contributing to the appeal of hardware sequencers often comes at the price of rigid limitations in the manipulation of the structure, both in terms of the signal path and the form of the sequences themselves.
% In the interactive scores formalism, implemented in the ossia score software\cite{jcelerier:thesis}, on which we propose to base our work, arrangements and effect chains, like all synthesis and input processing, can be defined with flexible duration, inside interactive timelines. Here lies the main challenge in attempting to fit ossia score's originality in a familiar practice. Even with button grids serving as very low-resolution touchscreens, and their various innovative uses of today allowing for example the display and control of basic widgets like sliders, routing matrices, patching environment or waveform editors; this research will necessitate a novel implementation (some of those have been listed here in a primitive taxonomy: forum.ossia.io/t/simplified-portable-interfaces/198). 
% We will strive to outline the specificities of performance-driven systems (as in \cite{nash:liveness}), while exploring new temporal paradigms (for example, a two dimensional representation of time as outlined in the following forum entry: forum.ossia.io/t/dynamic-reshaping-of-sequences/96).

\subsection{Existing literature}
% The field of interactive media notation \cite{ircam:antescofo}\cite{buzzing:iannix}\cite{grame:inscore} provides extensive references at the cross section of graphical user interface, human input and real-time constraints, which are central to this work. 
The elaboration of the branching timeline model is rooted in research applying Allen's interval algebra \cite{allombert:constraint} and Petri nets \cite{allombert:petri} to musical composition and performance. Conditional branching was later introduced \cite{toro:condition}, prompting further research to cope with the added complexity and uncertainty \cite{arias:colour}. 
% Recently, a research project by a student group at the University of Bordeaux identified several ways to improve the user interface to interact with this model, by comparing common practices across nodal environments (official web page: cmarty008.wixsite.com/ux-nodales). 
On the hardware side, the latest innovations are most likely presented at the International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME, official web page: nime.pubpub.org). The 2021 edition featured both an extensive survey on the use of grid controllers \cite{rossmy:grid} and a taxonomy for the specific type of interaction they demand \cite{pust:taxonomy}. This can serve as a base assessment for our purposes. 
% NIME also features creations of new hardware for sequencing \cite{arellano:radear}, exploring in some cases non-linear approaches \cite{hayes:neurohedron}. Several research projects also focused on rethinking and improving upon more classical designs \cite{snyder:jd} including button grids \cite{rossmy:touch}. 
Innovative work on hardware may also be done in a effort to bridge accessibility issues \cite{forester:loopblocks}\cite{vetter:tangible}, especially when doing away with the common use of a computer screen and a mouse. These concerns may also be relevant in the work proposed here, since we hope to provide full access to interactive score authoring without relying on GUIs. 
% Implementing a complete controller for the terminal could both be a useful milestone as well as a step towards greater accessibility, in particular for the sight-impaired \cite{payne:blind}. 
More broadly, the critique of human-computer interaction designed with windows, icons, menus and a pointer (WIMP) provides us with a rich background in user input and feedback \cite{baudouin:instrumental}\cite{beaudouin:interaction}. 

\subsection{Contribution to existing knowledge}
The work of Samuel J. Hunt \cite{hunt:poly} aims to remove the restriction to a single timeline. His Universal Grid Sequencer (UGS) allows to create independent sequences executed simultaneously on one or more button grids controllers. It leverages hardware interactions for more tangible feedback of potentially complex temporal and rhythmical relationships. 
% Instrumental patterns created with the UGS framework can fall in and out of phase or synchronisation according to predefined numbers of steps and tempos. Such patterns are designed in two distinct stages. Before starting the system, multiple instances are setup in software, with hard-coded voices, steps and tempo. The content of each pattern can then be edited on the fly once the system is running. 
With individual steps represented by a single cell of the physical interface, patterns of different length must run at different speeds to be synchronised. This is a graphical restriction imposed by the hardware display, but, as we hope to demonstrate in more details, it offers a new perspective on the representation of time. Although close to the research we propose, this work outlines the clear delineation between composition and performance that interactive scores challenge. In the UGS framework, like most step-sequencers, only rhythmical information, and pitch to a lower extent, are considered ``performable'' parameters. Tempo, time signature and structure in general rarely feature as authorable parameters. 
% Their consideration often belong solely to the realm of composition, arrangement or even mixing, distinct from performance in both time and tools.

\section{Research design and methodology} % Max 500 words
% Please detail the research design and methodologies to be employed in carrying out your scholarship which should be described in sufficient detail to demonstrate your thorough understanding of the research topic: 
Common practices on hardware interfaces, consumer preferences and comparative analysis of interactive systems are all preexisting research topics. As such, we consider selecting for a significant population sample, conducting interviews, collecting and analysing user data to be outside of the scope of this research. We will base our assessment of ergonomic design, intuitiveness and accessibility on existing academic literature \cite{rossmy:grid}\cite{pust:taxonomy}, as well as commercial product reviews. We aim at the same time to establish a basic set of time representation elements, compatible with our hardware of choice. This first exploratory phase implies delving into the theoretical aspects of temporal models \cite{toro:condition}\cite{milliere:topologie} to ensure that our basic elements are suited to a variety of formalisms. For our theoretical proposition to be exhaustive, we ought to divide it in parts of increasing complexity, from representation, to control, and finally to edition of temporal models. At every step of this progression, we hope to offer answers to our problem statement, firstly put in most general of terms: ``How can we interact with open ended, abstract software on finite physical interfaces ?'' 
% This question is particularly delicate with software straying far away from the norm, and hardware interfaces incarnating conventions in musical expression.
Such a set of generic temporal elements was defined in the branching timeline model of interactive scores\cite{jcelerier:thesis}. It is summarised by the following list:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{States}: a single point in time
    \item \textit{Events}: a group of simultaneous \textit{States}
    \item \textit{Syncs}: a group of simultaneous \textit{Events}
    \item \textit{Transitions}: instantaneous jump between two distinct \textit{Syncs}
    \item \textit{Intervals}: flexible duration connecting two distinct \textit{Syncs}
    \item \textit{Scenarios}: spanning the duration of an \textit{Interval}, it implements recursion and ordering
\end{itemize}
While this reduced set may suffice to represent interactive scores, additional elements are required to provide basic control:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Triggers}: extends or interrupts the predefined duration of \textit{Intervals}
    \item \textit{Conditions}: Allows the selection between parallel Intervals
\end{itemize}

As we claim edition to be an innovative part of this research, we may need to extend this set again, keeping in mind our objective of simplicity and minimalism. Reaching this stage of the research introduces the question: ``How can musicians rewrite a score as they are playing it ?''
As an example, a comparable hypothetical set of sequencer elements could be defined as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Steps}: a single ``point'' in time
    \item \textit{Sequences}: a circular chain of \textit{Steps}, spaced in multiples of a predefined musical subdivision
    \item \textit{Patterns}: a group of concurrent \textit{Sequences}
    \item \textit{Songs}: a linear arrangement of \textit{Patterns}
\end{itemize}
This list also features a one-to-one relationship with hardware interfaces elements: two display modes represent either \textit{Steps} or \textit{Patterns} with a single backlit button, and \textit{Sequences} or \textit{Songs} with one or several rows of backlit buttons.
Here again, control requires additional elements, defining for example the direction of the sequence:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Forward
    \item Backward
    \item Mirrored (forwards and backwards alternatively)
    \item Random
\end{itemize}
Throughout our three stage evolution, we'll attempt to bridge this gap between general temporal models and the particularities of musical time and instrumental performance. 

% The software design aspect of our research will follow this structure, to propose compatible yet isolated solutions to our problematic. A more modular approach will fit best our methodology, as well as improving code legibility, maintenance and re-usability. All development will be open source, thoroughly documented and tested, namely through unit testing\footnote{Wikipedia entry for unit testing: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit\_testing} and continuous integration\footnote{Wikipedia entry for continuous integration: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous\_integration}.

\subsection{Risks}
Possible risks preventing us from reaching our milestones may stem from limitations in our proposed methodology. Our hypothesis assumes the possibility of bridging two distinct literary corpus, theories relating to time and studies of hardware interaction in music. Two possible blockages can then be anticipated: either the gap is too wide between these fields, and no significant stride can be made without a missing link, or the connections are too obvious, trivialising our endeavour. We also dismiss the need to run human trials at the outset, and prefer relying on preexisting studies. It is possible that this approach turns out to be insufficient. The design of our temporal model may not fit hardware interfaces as well as expected for example. Even if it does fit, an original set of user interactions may be required to operate our system, making previous studies of established practices largely irrelevant for our purposes. 


\subsection{Contingency plans}
Our proposition may reveal itself too distant from the existing literature it hopes to connect. In this case, a more theoretical approach to bridge this gap should take precedent in our schedule. The opposite may be true, and our work ought to be more applied, delving deeper in specific use cases rather than general considerations. If human trials are required against our initial assumption, we reserve the right to reshape our schedule accordingly. Consent forms will have to be provided to conduct interviews, as well as a secure way to handle personal information.

\section{Specialist knowledge} % Max 500 words
% Please describe any specialist knowledge or data required to undertake your proposed research, such as language competency, technical skills or use of specialist software. If this knowledge or data is not already in place, details should be provided as to how it will be acquired over the course of the scholarship: 
A thorough theoretical understanding of the relevant temporal models will be necessary to propose striped down representations. Familiarity with the state of the art in this field will be acquired thorough reading relevant papers and strengthening background knowledge of more general use cases for temporal models in computer science and their origin. Theoretical understanding of user interaction and feedback in the field of ergonomics and human machine interaction (HMI) can also be acquired through the relevant literature. However, this particular aspect of our research may also require less conventional approaches to data collection: since hardware interfaces are consumer goods,  academic research and market studies, including customer reports, forum or blog entries, will provide a fuller picture.
Extracting relevant and reliable data from such a dense market may also prove challenging as it implies navigating corporate bias on one side and anecdotal evidence on the other. Courses on market research and product management (on campus or online) may also alleviate possible difficulties when involving the private sector in our research.
Additionally, in 2023, the new version of the programming language C++ (c++23) will be officially released. The previous version (c++20) introduced major new features in 2020 that this version will further extend. Mastering this modern, more generic approach to programming will be instrumental in ensuring the output of this research is as robust and future proof as possible (this blog entry outlines the use of these modern techniques in the writing of audio plugins: ossia.io/posts/reflection). To that effect, Maynooth University's course MU811 "Software Sound Synthesis" provides in-depth knowledge of musical programming environments. MU816 "Music Application Programming II" would allow exploration of newer versions of C++ and other courses from Computer Science can further help with necessary knowledge acquisition.

\section{Dissemination and Knowledge exchange} % Max 500 words
% Please outline your plans for the dissemination and knowledge exchange of your research, including publications, conference attendance, poster presentations, reports and outreach activities. Details should also be provided as to how the impact of your research will be measured:
Attending the NIME conference would be essential to meet the community and discover similar research projects. Presentations at The International Computer Music Conference (ICMC, icmc2022.org), the Sound and Music Computing Conference (SMC, smc2021conference.org) as well as the Linux audio conference (LAC, linuxaudio.org/lac.html) would also greatly help this research engage with its target audience. Papers and demonstrations detailing our progress at these events ought to benefit from expert insight. Online platforms are equally as valuable in this respect. The \textit{ossia} project boasts a strong web presence with its main website, online documentation, forum and multiple social media channels. These resources are already in use to promote the latest research by the \textit{ossia} team, showcase new features of the software, present various projects using the \textit{ossia} environment and provide support to users. The \textit{ossia} forum and chat rooms has proven over years to relay vital feedback. Although informal, these forms of direct communication with the user base is particularly efficient for an open-source project, where all can freely copy, edit and propose improvements to the software, the documentation or the website in the same way. To distribute these sources, we rely on the GitHub platform that also offers some level of analytics. It will help us in measuring the impact of our research by tracking fluctuation in user downloads, issues reported and proposed improvements throughout the project's evolution.

\subsection{Supervisor}
I was aware of Victor Lazzarini for sometimes prior to meeting him in person. His is very well known in the field of music technology. Gordon Delap always spoke very highly of him, and thanks to the Ulyses scheme, I was able to spent some time with Victor and his team. Meeting Him and attending his presentation on just-in-time compilation in the Csound programming environment was a joy. I was very impressed with the range of his expertise, as he described to me his project using volume capture technology to create binaural impulse responses, or his experimentation with Digital Signal Processing (DSP) on Graphical Processing Units (GPU). Even with such specific and complex topics, Victor seem to have this rare ability to put things plainly and simply. His technical competence can not be overstated and our research would benefit immensely from his input. To my delight, it is also clear that we share a passion for hardware, as his office is filled to the brim with synthesizers and keyboards of all kind. Victor is not only a very accomplished researcher, but a truly passionate musician too.

\subsection{Maynooth music technology}
The facilities of Maynooth's Music technology department offer everything our research could possibly need, with a wide range of recent and well maintained equipment and full featured production studios. From the group of students that attended our presentation and workshop, I also felt genuine curiosity and a generally very pleasant work atmosphere. The faculty at the time also counted Shane Byrne and Iain McCurdy.
Both where involved in our Ulyses scheme and both presented works with a strong emphasis on live interaction. Shane developed several iterations of a full body tracking system, and an extensive set of movements to control musical events in real time. Iain created several hardware instruments, notably his Cipher: a square grid of wholes in witch marbles can be placed. Every marble placed on the grid starts a musical sequence. It also affects in various ways the musical sequences represented by adjacent marbles (video and introduction: vimeo.com/8886750). Both of these creations offer a singular perspective on live interaction and representation of complex musical system on a simple grid. The research we propose here would then further explore topics already well established in this department.

\section{Current Ulysses scheme} % Max 300 words
Dr Gordon Delap and I are recipient of the 2021 Ulysses scheme. Ulysses is a French-Irish exchange program providing seed funding for reciprocal travel visits over the course of 16 months. It fosters new collaborations between researchers belonging to Irish and French institutions. Our ongoing project entitled ``Three dimensional audio and musical experimentation'' (code 47241QC) aims to extend the work we started during Gordon's sabbatical. For almost a year prior to our application, Gordon was testing and composing with the software \textit{Mosca} \cite{mott:mosca} that I develop. Gordon's unique approach and technical proficiency provided great insight for further development and fine tuning of the software. The Ulysses grant allowed me to visit the university of Maynooth and the staff of the music technology department, as Well as the Sonic Arts Research Centre (SARC) in Belfast. Gordon and I also gave a talk and a workshop for students and faculty in Maynooth. Subsequently, Dr Iain McCurdy, Dr Shane Byrne and Professor Victor Lazzarini were invited to give public presentation at SCRIME (Studio for Creation and Research in Experimental Music: scrime.u-bordeaux.fr). We are currently organising the second set of presentations scheduled in our program.

\subsection{Research achievements} % Max 300 words
% Please provide any additional information regarding your research achievements to date such as publications, research awards, creation of data sets and databases, conference papers, patents, excavations, public broadcasts, stage performances, creative writing, creative productions and/or exhibitions:
In 2019, Iain Mott and I co-wrote a report of our new development of the \textit{Mosca} software. We gave a talk and a demonstration based on this paper\cite{mott:mosca} in Lisbon. That same year, I was very fortunate to present my work \cite{keller:linux} at the Linux Audio Conference (LAC) at Stanford university. My colleague Jean-Michaël Celerier and I then hosted the following edition of LAC in Bordeaux, with the help of both public and private partners (lac2020.sciencesconf.org). Pierre Cochard and I introduced our integration of the \textit{ossia} library in the \textit{supercollider} environment in this edition's lightning talks session (video recording: tube.aquilenet.fr/w/grYCGxyuVE8Gw5NEMDA6g8). 

Languages, semantics and statistical analysis specialist Bernard Serpette was also a regular collaborator of mine on several arts and science projects. I consider our publication together\cite{serpette:aleas} a rare chance in my career. 
In 2019 and 2021, I represented the \textit{ossia} team at several workshops in Montreal. The first one was hosted at the Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Music Media and Technology (CIRMMT, www.cirmmt.org/en) and was concluded by public presentations (www.cirmmt.org/en/events/workshops/research/intermedia\_mapping\_scripting\_workshop/mapping\_workshop). Two years later, we flew over as part of our International Emerging Actions (IEA, CNRS) project: ``Writing time and interaction''. Workshops where then held at the Input Devices and Music Interaction Laboratory (IDMIL, http://www-new.idmil.org/), the Topological Media Lab (TML, topologicalmedialab.net) and The Society for Arts and Technology (SAT, sat.qc.ca/en).

% My expertise in multichannel audio also brought me in 2020 to the university of Bilbao, where I was asked to coordinate the installation of an immersive sound system, and introduce students and faculty to its use.

In 2021, the Berlin based company LUCH.US started using \textit{Mosca} in combination with \textit{ossia score} for the ``PARALLEL WELT'' project (www.english.luchs.us/parallel-world). The principal of this project was first developed by Iain Mott \cite{mott:botanica} and further optimised by Gaël Jaton and myself \cite{jaton:moscanica}. ``PARALLEL WELT'' was presented at the 2021 edition of the ``Places\_VR'' festival in Germany (places-festival.de/en).

\subsection{Work experience} % Max 300 words
% Please provide details of any relevant work experience, including voluntary work, to date which should include employers’ names, job titles, nature of duties and responsibilities, as well as duration of employment:
Form 2017 to 2021 I have been employed at SCRIME, first as an intern, then as a technical assistant on a university contract, and finally as a engineer contracted by the CNRS (french national scientific research center: www.cnrs.fr/en). Under the direction of Myriam Desainte-Catherine and György Kurtág, I have focused on three-dimensional audio and interactive scoring. I provided technical support for projects combining research and artistic applications (such as this project: www.compagnie-ever.com/aleas). Working at SCRIME I was also introduced to its many interactive hardware projects relevant to the research we propose, such as Christophe Havel's ``Air percussion'' \cite{havel:air}, Serge Delaubier's ``MetaInstrument'' (www.pucemuse.com/meta-instrument-4), and most notably, the ``Lemur Input Device'' interface (www.jazzmutant.com/behindthelemur).
Since the end of 2021, I have been the lead developer of the Viage client application for the real-estate market (source code: github.com/EuclidTradingSystems/viage). Ease of use, layout simplicity and navigation clarity have been central concerns in this work. Cross-platform compatibility and performance also played a substantial role in trying to provide a seamless experience for non-technical users. Direct contact with the client also offered me a privileged look into the scrutiny required by the private sector in terms of convenience and intuitive interfaces. Concurrently, I am also working as the Systems administrator for the Euclid company, overseeing the migration to their new data-center (euclidtradingsystems.com). This position involves hardware installation and maintenance, as well as the upkeep and improvement of the software infrastructure to ensure that daily operations are running smoothly.

Questions relating to time have fascinated me since enrolling for the EHESS master's degree. Although I always had an interest, I was first introduced to the true depth of the topic by the writings of Olivier Messian. The first volume of his seminal treatise on rhythm, color and ornithology\cite{messian:ornithology} opens with wide ranging musings on the difference between, physical, psychological, relative, micro and macro time. I then registered for the "Philosophy of time" seminar that  dispensed a much more technical analysis of these questions. ``Introduction to the topology of time''\cite{milliere:topologie} particularly grabbed me, in part because it mentioned the relevance of its subject for the field of computer science. I had a more literary use for these notions in my masters thesis: establishing a portrait of the musician Ahmad Mansour, for whom the only written accounts were album reviews disseminated through the many years of his career. I was very pleased to come back to the topic once I started my internship in music technology. I was now training to garner technical skills in programming at SCRIME and amongst the \textit{ossia} team. The then ongoing Phd thesis on the subject by Jean-Michaël Celerier\cite{jcelerier:thesis} offered me a completely new perspective. As he was developing the software \textit{ossia score} through his research, I first took on the task of testing and reporting bugs, before starting to contribute to the source code. Although the context had changed, I felt a real sense of continuity with my previous exposure to the abstract subject of time. I was now taking part in direct applications of problems I previously discovered in philosophy classes. With increased work obligations however, I had to focus more and more on practicality and efficiency, leaving aside some of these more academic concerns. The research I propose represents an opportunity for me to delve back and further explore theories of time, indulging again in the passion they ignited in me many years ago. 
During my time at SCRIME, I also organised weekly meet-ups with local artists to introduce the latest features in \textit{ossia score} and \textit{Mosca}, propose use cases and collect feedback. This experience outlined for me the difference between teaching, assisting and beta-testing. Thinking initially that these tasks could overlap, I now know from experience that they are mutually exclusive. This is why I propose a methodology based on existing literature rather than first-hand experimentation with live users. Amongst researchers and developers, artists are the target audience of the research we hope to undertake. Ultimately, we hope to further the range of musical expression, and believe this daunting task to be better served by a segmented approach. As such, we consider collecting the invaluable input of end users to represent an entire subject of its own, and ought to be the sole object of independent research.

\section{Career training and development plan} % Max 1000 words

%     • What are your career goals and how would this scholarship help you to achieve them?
%     • How will you go about acquiring the expert knowledge and transferable skills necessary for your professional development, e.g. technical skills, communication skills, analytical skills?

The \textit{ossia} team and ossia.io french-canadian non-profit organization, of which I am a proud member, has been dedicated to open-source software since its inception. Our non-profit is occasionally funded by research grants or special development contracted by users requesting new features. The creation of a commercial product is often discussed amongst members when evaluating ways to generate stable revenue. I believe that proposing hardware and embedded solutions could introduce our work to a vibrant consumer base. For a number of years now, hardware sequencers, synthesizers and samplers have had a strong revival. Online communities, often rallied under the ``DAWless'' banner (without Digital Audio Workstation) promote making music away from the computer, preferring instead dedicated equipment. This practice has some overlap with modular synthesis, another booming market of recent years, counting small independent module creators in the hundreds. Still, competition is fierce, and although original designs abound, a clear delineation with ``mainstream'' products can be noted. Even with this wealth of available research in the domain of creative interfaces, the private sector seems to lead the way, at least for popularizing the latest innovations. While many of the products on the market today were made possible by previous academic research, it is indeed landmark commercial products and their widespread availability that sets the standard. Today, for example, the step-sequencer method of ``punching in'' steps along a fixed timeline has become a staple of the producer's toolset. As such, one could argue that the practice demonstrates intuitiveness by restriction, if only to the familiarity of a tried-and-true paradigm. 
% It is my assumption that the program Ableton Live in particular, with its long held monopoly and well established feature set, may hinder fair comparisons against a new research project. 
Innovations in this domain face the added challenge of matching the industry standard in term of usability and convenience. The proposed research hopes to meet this challenge, and in the process, provide open source, generic implementations of button grids interactions and feedback. I believe that laying this ground work can be beneficial for further research on these user experiences, and for the creation of our own \textit{ossia} hardware products.
Since I started working in the private sector, I continued developing similar relationship with clients as I have with artists. In both cases I found it always more productive to anticipate as much as possible users behaviours and expectations rather than hoping to build a product through constant back-and-forth. An expertise in user interaction, backed by a strong practice of modern programming standards and software design, as I aim to build with this Phd, would supply a very active demand in IT.

This pursuit for seamless interactions would also tie in with previous theoretical research on embedded systems considering the implementation of interactive scores in Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) \cite{arias:fpga}. Working with dedicated hardware and harnessing the optimizations they enable would yield great improvements for the reactivity of real-time interactions \cite{popoff:fpga}.

% your own custom macro containing the \includegraphics command to make things
% simpler here.)
